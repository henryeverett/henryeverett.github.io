If I could give one piece of advice to someone about their user-facing product it would be: *Get your app out of the way of your app.* Simplify your user experience until the core journey is so easy to complete it hurts. Don't simplify just for the sake of simplicity however - simplify with your user in mind. Ask yourself: 'What is the primary goal of my app? What does my user want to do when they open it?' and throw everything else away.

It's so easy to muddy your UI with cool features that actually end up obscuring the end goal of your user journey. I work at Happiour, a London-based coupon app which lists nearby time-sensitive offers. The app has evolved through various iterations to get to where it is today and it's still evolving. The original conception of the app was focussed heavily on using basic social networking features within the app to increase retention of users. We built this and released it and to our surprise our users weren't using the features. On further digging into our analytics, it turned out that the social features were interrupting the core user journey!

Scaling back the social features helped clarify that journey and taught us a couple of important lessons. First of all, prioritise your users' goals above your business goals, because ultimately if your users aren't interested in your product, you don't have a business. We thought that providing an invite system within the app would keep users hooked, while that may work further down the line, it's crucial that the product's core journey is easy and clear enough first that users *want* to invite their friends.
Second, don't make assumptions about your users. Don't guess which features they will like, ask them. Talk to your users on a regular basis, find out what they think the app needs then trial those features, making sure you keep that core journey crystal clear and free of any roadblocks.
